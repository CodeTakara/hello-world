# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub per the intro guide.
Hello there, I am in a tech training program where I am learning SQL, Python, doing fun stuff in Linux bash, 
and soon will be learning a crash course in Selenium using Python. 
I'm learning how to use GitHub with their new user tutorial. Cheers!
